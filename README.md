# Loose Equality with Null and Undefined in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a common pitfall in JavaScript related to the loose equality operator (`==`) when comparing `null` and `undefined`.  The loose equality operator does not perform strict type checking and can lead to unexpected results, especially when dealing with `null` and `undefined` values.

## The Problem

The provided JavaScript code shows how `null` and `undefined` are treated inconsistently when using the `==` operator.  While `null == undefined` evaluates to `true`, the behavior when used in a conditional or arithmetic operation can be inconsistent and lead to unexpected results, like producing `NaN` in the addition operation.

## The Solution

Using the strict equality operator (`===`) is recommended to avoid this issue. Strict equality checks for both value and type, ensuring more predictable behavior.  This helps improve code reliability and reduces unexpected behavior.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's root directory.
3. Open `bug.js` to see the buggy code.
4. Open `bugSolution.js` to see how the issue is corrected.
5. Run the JavaScript files using a Node.js environment or a web browser's console.
